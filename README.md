marknotes
=========

MarkNotes is a simple note-taking application that supports creating, deleting, and organizing your notes. It supports markdown syntax. It won't be a feature-rich application. I'm developing it just to suit my needs.

Dependencies:
* Qt >= 4.8
* Discount http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/
